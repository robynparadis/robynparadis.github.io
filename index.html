        <h1>Hi, I'm Robyn!</h1>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>Thank you for viewing my application website for the role of Support Specialist - Themes at Shopify! I'm a full-time Support Advisor, and a part-time small business owner. I currently live in central Alberta, in the MST time zone. My favorite font is Helvetica, and my favorite color is #8474A1, which is the color of the navigation bar and footer on this page. I love playing video games and making art with any medium I can get my hands on. I also have a dog named <a href="baker.html">Baker</a> who is my best friend.</p>

            <h2>First & Foremost.. <em>The Application Questions</em></h2>
                <h3>Have any relevant experience? Tell us about it! We would love to hear your story.</h3>
                    <p>I have experience dating back to 2013<em>ish</em>, when I took the <strong>Intro to Computing and Information Systems</strong>
                    course at Athabasca University. The course covered basic hardware concepts, the software hierarchy, from systems 
                    software to application programs, as well as concepts and development of the field. We also learned the basics of
                    Python in this course, but I'm a bit rusty there.</p>
                    <p>More recently, I've re-taken the Codecademy Learn HTML Course, as well as the Learn CSS course, and both of those
                    certificates can be found on the <a href="certificates.html">Certificates page</a>. :)</p>
            <br>
                <h3>What recent skills have you developed? (It does not need to be technical in nature.)</h3>
                    <p>I've been developing my skills (or lack thereof!) in diet and exercise recently, as I work through an 8 week long
                    program that involves eating healthier, and learning new exercises that I can do at home. This has definitely
                    improved my cooking skills, and my appreciation for cold water and high-speed fans.</p>
                    <p>I also recently audited <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/getting-started-with-google-sheets" target="_blank">Coursera's Google Sheets course</a>, to improve my knowledge of the Google suite of products,
                    and I've developed my skills in packing up cardboard boxes, as I prepare for a move to another city at the beginning of August!</p>
            <br>
                <h3>Explain why you are interedted in Theme Support? Is there a particular aspect of our work that excites you?</h3>
                    <p>Theme Support has always been one of my favorite teams, both to interact with, and in terms of the work that they do.
                    I'm a visual person, so getting to understand and work with how Merchant's stores are displayed is so exciting for me.
                    I've always loved learning and getting to work with coding languages, and I think that coupled with my experience as a
                    Support Advisor, I could be a great fit for the role!</p>
