        <h1>Hi, I'm Robyn!</h1>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>Thank you for viewing my application website! I'm a full-time Support Advisor, and recently retired from my small business after 4 years. I currently live in Calgary, in the MST time zone. My favorite font is Helvetica, and my favorite color is #8474A1, which is the color of the navigation bar and footer on this page. I love playing video games and making art with any medium I can get my hands on. I also have a dog named <a href="baker.html">Baker</a> who is my best friend.</p>

            <h2>Also..</h2>
                    <p>I have experience dating back to 2013<em>ish</em>, when I took the <strong>Intro to Computing and Information Systems</strong>
                    course at Athabasca University. The course covered basic hardware concepts, the software hierarchy, from systems 
                    software to application programs, as well as concepts and development of the field. We also learned the basics of
                    Python in this course, but I'm a bit rusty there.</p>
                    <p>More recently, I've re-taken the Codecademy Learn HTML Course, as well as the Learn CSS course, and both of those
                    certificates can be found on the <a href="certificates.html">Certificates page</a>. I also have a small amount of (self-taught) graphic design experience, as I created graphics from scratch for my small business (and some small doodles and artwork for friends!) using the Procreate app for iPad.</p>
